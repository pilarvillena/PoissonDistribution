**About the book "The Art of Statistics", by David Spiegelhalter**

When I was at the university studying Statistics (and after that a master in Statistics), one of the most incomprehensible subjects for me it was "simulation". 
Everyone was so happy and confident about the great usefulness of this tecnique but my mind could not understant how in earth we can be so sure that a random event can be connected with a distribution function. I must say I was not a good student then (at least in pre-grade), so I just ignored these concerns and tried to aprove the courses.

I suppose there were some people who had the same concern as me, but I never heard about it. 
Until recently, in July of this year I had the opportunity to buy this amazing book and you can imagine my ilusion when I read this:

*"But what is the justification for building a probability distribution? The number of homicides recorded each day in a country is simply a fact - there has been no sampling, and there is no explicit random element generating each unfortunate event. Just an immensely complex and unpredictable world. But whatever our personal philosophy behind luck or fortune, it turns out that it is useful to act as if these events were produced by some random process that can be modelled by probability"*

*"Even though there is a unique story behind every one of these tragic events most of which are unpredictable, the data act as if they were actually generated by some known random mechanism*

In chapter 8 of the book, the author explain how to calculate the probability of seeing 5 homicide incidents in England and Wales in a single day. He used the Poisson distribution to answer this question and to find the number of expected days in two years with 5 homicides in a day. Incredibly, expected value and observed value is almost the same.

In the chapter 10 of the book he explains how to test formally whether the Poisson distribution assumption is justified.

In this notebook I just replicate his exercise using real data about the number of fatal traffic accidents each day in Per√∫.

I am doing this exercise for educational purposes. I think that seeing the theory applied to real data can help us understand the fundamentals of statistics and not just apply the formula for the sake of it.

There are so many interesting exercises in the book I just hope I can replicate most of them.
